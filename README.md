# Nimbus

A PC game created in Unity for the 2014 LIVE Lab Game Jam, hosted at Texas A&M University.

##Theme: Water

You're the newest manager at Nimbus, the world's first literal "cloud" company.  
Your job seems pretty simple: help satisfy the water needs of the cities around you with our patented remote-controlled cloud technology.
But your resources are limited, and clouds can only move so fast.  Will you let some cities fall to ruin to protect others?
Or can you balance everything well enough to help them all?  The choice is yours.
